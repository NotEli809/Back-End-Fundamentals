# Simple CRUD
This is a Simple CRUD I made to practice my backend fundamentals using Node.js and express.
This CRUD manages heroes and villains.
As of now only Hero/Villain name and alter ego are stored.
Get method for Heroes and Villains pulls up their info by using their Hero/Villain name.
| Methods  | Description | Example | 
| ---------|:-------------:| -----:|
| GET      | Gets every hero/villain by their hero/villain name | ./heroes/Super Human |
| POST     | Posts a new hero/villain using the info on the body | ./heroes/ |
| PULL     | Modifies an existing hero/villain by ID and replaces the existing info with the one on the body | ./heroes/1 |
| DELETE   | Deletes a hero/villain by ID | ./heroes/7 |
